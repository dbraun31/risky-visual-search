The reason is because I realized quickly in the study that I could tolerate having to look at 14 additional objects, but could not tolerate the chance of having to look at 28 additional objects. 

For that reason, when I had to choose between 0 or +14 and +7, I usually chose the risky deck (0 or +14). I viewed the risky deck as a safe deck because I could still identify the red and green object easily when there were 14 additional objects on screen, so I didn't care that I had a 50% chance to get that outcome, and there was a 50% chance that it was easier to identify the red and green object because there were no additional objects on the screen.

When I had to choose between 0 or -28 and -14, I almost always chose the -14 option. The reason why is because I feel there wasn't much of an increase in efficiency if I only had four objects to look at as opposed to eighteen. I found that reducing the number of objects on screen by a guaranteed 14 significantly increased my efficiency in identifying the red and green object, enough to where I felt like it wasn't worth having the chance to reduce the number of objects on screen by an additional 14.

I tended to be inconsistent in choosing between 0 or -14 and -7. Towards the end of the study, I started to prefer the 0 or +14 option. The reason was because I realized that reducing the number of objects by seven didn't greatly increase efficiency in identifying the red and green object compared to if there were a normal number of objects on screen, so I felt it was better to have a chance to reduce the number of objects by 14 and make the process of looking through the objects a lot faster.",somewhat_disagree,strongly_disagree,neutral,somewhat_disagree,neutral,somewhat_disagree,somewhat_disagree,strongly_agree,neutral,neutral,somewhat_disagree,strongly_disagree,somewhat_disagree,neutral,somewhat_disagree,somewhat_agree,strongly_disagree,somewhat_disagree
