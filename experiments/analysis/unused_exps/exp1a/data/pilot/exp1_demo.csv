I was wondering though if targets were more likely to show up in certain locations, it sort of seemed that way. The experiment took me close to an hour but I made a fair amount of errors, so that may have contributed"

Overall it took me about 45 minutes because I had to stop for an emergency before continuing the 3rd trial. The instructions regarding the risky and safe deck were a bit confusing, but as the experiment went on it made more sense (a bit of a learning curve for me)."

I feel like that sounds less awkward but that is just my opinion. "

It took me roughly 45 minutes once I had clicked ""begin."" In the end, it did take a while to switch to this demographics survey, and instead just showed a blank rectangle for where the addition or subtraction of graphics was located. However, it did eventually switch to this form, so I don't think I had any issues!"

I did not encounter any errors except a slight glitch as the end it said there was 0 blocks left and when I pressed continue the two decks still popped up for a second."
