David Braun: For the rest of the experiment, there will only be one small change. Instead of seeing how many total objects you'll be getting in the next search trial, you'll be seeing how many extra objects you're getting relative to 32.

2
00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:24.570
David Braun: So that means that zero is zero extra objects, so if you get this outcome, that means you'll be searching among 32 objects, just like you did in that initial practice round, which is medium difficulty.

3
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:37.740
David Braun: If you see a minus sign with a number next to it that's how many objects fewer than 32 you'll be searching among, so these ones with the minus sign are easier because they reduce the amount of objects, you need to search through.

4
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:53.100
David Braun: You'll also be seeing some with a plus sign next to it that's how many extra objects above 32 you'll need to search between. So you can see here, plus 28 is plus 28 over 32 and this one's more difficult.
