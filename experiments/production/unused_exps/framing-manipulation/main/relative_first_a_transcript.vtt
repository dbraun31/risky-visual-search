00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:13.259
In that last practice phase you searched among 32 objects on the screen like this. We've had a lot of people take this study, and most people would agree that 32 objects is about a medium level of difficulty.

2
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.520
As you take objects away the search becomes easier, as you add objects to the screen the search the search becomes more difficult.

3
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:31.770
For the rest of this study you'll be choosing between two options like this. The D key selects the left option, the F key selects the right option.

4
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:43.380
The numbers on these options, called the outcomes, tell you about how many objects, more or fewer than 32 you'll be searching among on next trial.

5
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:51.420
So we see that zero means zero extra objects means you'll be searching 32 objects, just like you did in the practice phase.

6
00:00:52.080 --> 00:01:00.030
When you have numbers with a plus sign next to them, that's how many objects more than 32 you'll be searching among and so those are going to be a little bit more difficult.

7
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:10.200
You'll see two numbers on this option over here, this is what we can call a risky option, there will always be one of these, and one safe option.

8
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:26.550
For the risky option choosing this you'll get one of these outcomes, according to a point five probability so it's like flipping a coin, to determine which one you'll get. If I select this right option, the safe one, I know that I'll get seven more than 32.

9
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.780
So in this case, we got 14 more than 32 objects it's a little bit more difficult.

10
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:46.680
You'll also be getting trials we'll see numbers or outcomes, with a minus sign next to them that's how many objects fewer than 32 you'll be doing so you can imagine that these outcomes will be much easier.

11
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.590
This time we got 42 less than 39, we can see that there's far fewer objects much easier to make the search decision.

12
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.610
So when you're ready to begin this next phase of the experiment press the button on the lower right hand side of the screen to begin.
