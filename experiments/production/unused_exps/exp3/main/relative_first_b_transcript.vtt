00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:10.920
For the rest of the experiment, there will only be one small change. Instead of seeing how many objects, more or fewer than 32 you're about to search on,

2
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:27.810
now you just see how many total objects you're going to be searching on so, for example, instead of zero you're seeing 32 as an outcome or you'll see for objects has now come on So if you were to get a floor here, that means you're just searching among for objects.

3
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.940
And likewise when the numbers are greater than 32 these mean you're going to be searching through this many 39 objects.
