# Wave 1 Experiments - Methodological Development   
   
The purpose of this wave of experiments is to develop a version of the reference dependent   
dst using task switching where effort demand is manipulated by a response time window. I'm   
envisioning two experiments:   
   
* A version that closely matches the visual search version, using a small set of window   
    times framed around a constant reference point.   
* A version that varies the window time parametrically, constrained such that there are   
    trials where the same outcomes are framed as gains or losses.
