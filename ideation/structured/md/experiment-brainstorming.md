# Experiment Brainstorming

A mostly unstructured space where I'm just listing out the soup of things I want to
integrate into experiments.

* **More precise measurement**
    * Calibrate participant-wise effort demand
    * Continue measuring NFC
    * Include Cog-ED
    * Eye tracking / pupil dilation
        * Would be logistically challenging
    * Get estimation of prospect theory parameters in traditional, monetary context
        * Or just some independent measure of risk preference


* **Manipulations**
    * Which task to use?
        * I'd like to go back to task switching because of the more robust effect size
        * But I'll have to deal with the inconsistency compared to E1
        * Can enforce a response time window in task switching to parametrically
            manipulate effort demand. This would require some manipulation validation,
            though.
    * Intersperse unequal EV trials
        * This should serve to measure decision sensitivity
        * I'll have to think about exactly how to quantify this
    * Include mouse-hover contingent outcomes
        * This should provide a way to get at the influence of attention on choice
    * Anchoring the reference point high / low
    * Optional break periods
        * Duration of break serves as a dv
    * Things to control for:
        * Probability
        * Competing motivation
        * Time on task
    * From Mason et al
        * include trials that are matched on risk but vary in demand to weed out demand
            seekers
        * single option 'choices' to ensure Ps experience all difficulty levels

* **Modeling**
    * Brainstorm some competing candidate models
    * What are ways that parameter estimation could tease apart competing hypotheses?

* **Misc**
    * Getting creative about possible converging measures
    * Keeping in mind the distinction between instantaneous vs prospective costs
    * Read empirical Inzlicht papers to get inspiration on how to rigorously document a
        phenomenon
    * Read papers coming out of Shenhav's lab to get a sense of how to incorporate
        modeling and Bayesian hierarchical parameter estimation
    * Remember that each modifcation needs to be motivated by careful consideration of
        questions around the phenomenon. Each addition should help to test between clearly
        outlined competing explanations for the phenomenon.
