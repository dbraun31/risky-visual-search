# Experiments Outline

This is a broad outline of the experiments to be run in Spring 2023. See links below for
more detail.

        controls.

## Wave 1 - Methodological Development

Wave 1 will involve extending the effort demanding task to a task switching context where
effort demand is manipulated using a response time window.

Wave 1 will also involve parametrically manipulating effort demand and testing hypotheses
via parameter estimation.

## Wave 2 - Dynamic Reference Point

Wave 2 will test mechansisms around how a reference point of mental effort intensity is
established and how flexible it is. Given a paradigm allowing for parametric manipulation
of effort demand, we can manipulate the level of the reference point either between
participants or between trials. 

*Don't forget: When manipulating between trials, we can test the hypothesis that people
aren't updating reference points after each trial but rather adopting one reference point
throughout. We could test this by including the reference point as a between-subject
parameter and comparing model fits to a model where the reference point comes from the
data.*

## Wave 3 - Flipping Cost Functions

Wave 3 will investigate the hypothesis that mental effort is evaluated with a traditional
cost function when outcomes are only described and a reversed cost function when outcomes
are experienced. 

There are two central manipulations we can use to address this question:

* The extent to which outcomes are described vs. experienced
    * This can be manipulated discretely or on a continuum, although continuous
        manipulation might demand a prohibitively large sample size
* Use mouse-hover contingent outcome display to test hypotheses about interactions with
    visual attention.
